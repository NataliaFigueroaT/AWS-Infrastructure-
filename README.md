Hello guys! 

I'm glad to share this with you. Thanks to this task I was able to learn how to create a VM using terraform, what a Network Balance is and how to deploy website and then clean up. 

Thanks to the oportunity and I feel like this is just a start of this journey as a DevOps. 

On the files you will found the scripts to creates each instance as well as the network balance and last but no least, the PS to install IIS on my VM and deploy a ''Hello World''. 

Please let me know any suggestion to improve the way I did it.
